**üößWIP**
-
Current future plans are as follows:
- Add more examples of well-known molecule binding conformities to the render samples library
- Create a free material library so others can create a greater variety of visually appealing biochemical renders

**üî®TOOLS USED**
- 
 SwissDock: Used to virtually dock ligand and target
 
 PyMOL v3.1: Used to create initial render, clean, and convert to blender-compatible file format
 
 PyViewDock: Used as a bridge to import .dock4 file into PyMOL
 
 Blender v4.4: Used to create and modify final render
 
 Molecular Nodes: Used to import PDBx file into Blender and contributed heavily to final render


**‚ùìFAQs**
- 
Q: *I'm a biochemist looking to adopt this workflow - where should I start?*

A: There are a multitude of tutorials available for Blender. If you're serious about learning the software I'd start with everyone else - at
[The Donut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haAdmHqGOw). If you just want work with biological molecules, then I can wholeheartedly recommend [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvmFaRVmZRU) by the creator of Molecular Nodes. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions - I'd be glad to help.

All work is my own, and any suggestions for improvement or iteration are welcome.
