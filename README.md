**Description**
-
This repo and attached report provide instructions on how to generate images just like the above for use in reports, conferences and publications. Included is a template .blend file so you can use the materials I've created, alongside PyMOL exports in .pdb format for each of the binding conformities generated by SwissDock.
Only one more update intended for this repo to include brief animations for each of the above example renders.

**Tools**
- 
 SwissDock: Used to virtually dock ligand and target
 
 PyMOL v3.1: Used to create initial render, clean, and convert to blender-compatible file format
 
 PyViewDock: Used as a bridge to import .dock4 file into PyMOL
 
 Blender v4.4: Used to create and modify final render
 
 Molecular Nodes: Used to import PDBx file into Blender and contributed heavily to final render


**FAQs**
- 
Q: *I'm a biochemist looking to adopt this workflow - where should I start?*

A: There are a multitude of tutorials available for Blender. If you're serious about learning the software I'd start with everyone else - at
[The Donut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haAdmHqGOw). If you just want work with biological molecules, then I can wholeheartedly recommend [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvmFaRVmZRU) by the creator of Molecular Nodes. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions - I'd be glad to help.

All work is my own, and any suggestions for improvement or iteration are welcome.
